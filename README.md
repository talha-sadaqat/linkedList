This C code implements a simple program to create a linked list of toppings for a pizza. The program creates a structure called "pizzaMaker" to store the name of the topping and a pointer to the next topping in the list. This structure is then used to create a linked list of toppings.

The program first creates a node with the topping "onion" and assigns it to be the head of the linked list. Then the program prompts the user to enter another topping and adds it to the end of the linked list.

The program then adds the topping "Green Pepper" to the beginning of the linked list using the AddTopping1() function. Then it adds the topping "Pepperoni" to the end of the linked list using the AddTopping2() function.

The program then displays all the toppings in the linked list using the displayAllToppingsR() function, which uses recursion to print out each topping. Finally, the clearList() function is called to free up the memory used by the linked list.
